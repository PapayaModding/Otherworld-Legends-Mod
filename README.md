# 🦉 Otherworld-Legends-Mod

> This repo is a guide to modding in Steam version of [Otherworld Legends](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761380/Otherworld_Legends/) - a 2D spritesheet action game. This guide covers the most cases of typical spritesheet modding in Unity game (yes, the methods could be migrated to other Unity games if spritesheet is used). I promise you will be surprised if you only know how to replace texture file.
